<p>An apple is a kind of fruit .I like eating it very much.An apple is round.
Its colour is green,it is not big,.It smells sweet and tastes good ,
and it is a little sour.An apple is full of vitamin in it,it is good for us.
So we say,”An apple a day keeps the doctor away”</p>

<p>Apple lets people think of George Washington,whose honesty story is still inspiring the young.
Apple is healthy because it is said that one apple a day is better than a good doctor.</p>

<p>In China,there is a story titled “Story of an Apple”,
which is about some brave Chinese soldiers in bad living conditions sharing an apple
 and reflects their great spirits.</p>
