An apple is a kind of fruit .I like eating it very much.An apple is round.Its colour is green,it is not big,.It smells sweet and tastes good ,and it is a little sour.An apple is full of vitamin in it,it is good for us.So we say,"An apple a day keeps the doctor away"

Apple lets people think of George Washington,whose honesty story is still inspiring the young.Apple is healthy because it is said that one apple a day is better than a good doctor.

In China,there is a story titled "Story of an Apple",which is about some brave Chinese soldiers in bad living conditions sharing an apple and reflects their great spirits.
